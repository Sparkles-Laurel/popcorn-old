# Source code
This directory contains the source code for the kernel.

## List of examples of things that should go here:
- ...Any code at all for this, really. This is where the kernel is written.

## Sorting
Please sort your code by the following rules:
- If the code handles and manages hardware directly, it should go in the `system` directory.
- If the code is part of the kernel, but does not manage hardware directly, it should go in the `kernel` directory.
