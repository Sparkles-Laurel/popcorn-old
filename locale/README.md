# Localization text files
In this directory goes text files that are essentially 'pasted' into the kernel at compile time. This is used for localization, and is not used for anything else.

## List of examples of things that should go here:
- The text you see on a kernel panic, and other error messages

## List of examples of things that should NOT go here:
- Code. Please use [the source code directory](../src/README.md) for code.
- Anything that is not text.
